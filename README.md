6. Create a program that calculates the area of a rectangle (length Ã— width) using variables and arithmetic operations.
7. Write a Python program that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
8. Write a program that asks for a number and prints whether it is even or odd using the modulus operator.

## 3. Dictionaries
