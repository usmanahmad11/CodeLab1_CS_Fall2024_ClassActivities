**Duration:** 1.5 hours

---

## **Learning Objectives:**
- Understand what programming is and its importance.
- Install Python and set up the programming environment.
- Write your first Python program.

---

## 1. Introduction to Programming (15 minutes)

### **1.1 What is Programming?**
- **Definition:** Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.
- **Importance of Programming:**
  - Programming is used to automate tasks, solve complex problems, create software applications, and much more.
  - Discuss real-world applications such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and game development.

- **Different Programming Languages:**
  - Brief overview of popular programming languages: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript.
  - Why Python? Explain its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries that make it a great choice for beginners.

### **1.2 How Computers Understand Programs**
- Explain the role of compilers and interpreters in converting code into machine language.
- Mention how Python is an interpreted language, which means it executes code line by line.

## 2. Setting Up the Python Environment (20 minutes)

### **2.1 Installing Python**
- **Windows:**
  - Guide students to download and install Python from the official website [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
  - Show how to verify the installation by typing `python --version` in the command prompt.

- **Mac/Linux:**
  - Explain that Python often comes pre-installed on these systems.
  - Show how to check the version using `python3 --version` in the terminal.
  - Guide students to install Python if it’s not present.

### **2.2 Setting Up an IDE**
- **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):**
  - Introduce popular IDEs like VSCode, PyCharm, and Jupyter Notebook.
  - Explain why an IDE is useful for writing, testing, and debugging code.

- **Installing VSCode:**
  - Walk through the process of installing VSCode.
  - Demonstrate how to install the Python extension in VSCode.

- **Setting Up Jupyter Notebook (Optional):**
  - Explain how Jupyter Notebook is great for interactive coding, especially for data science.
  - Guide students to install it using `pip install notebook` and run it using `jupyter notebook`.

## 3. Writing Your First Python Program (15 minutes)

### **3.1 Python Syntax and Structure**
- **Basic Syntax:**
  - Python uses indentation to define code blocks (no need for curly braces `{}`).
  - Discuss how Python is case-sensitive.
  - Variables don’t need explicit declaration; the type is inferred from the value assigned.

### **3.2 Writing and Running a Simple Script**
- **Hello, World! Program:**
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
